## retrieve-transaction-history feature

This is a slash command for retrieving one's most recent 10 coin transactions. 

The function structure is service-controller-divided. Controller is only for handling requests, parsing information and forwarding to a corresponding backend service. 

In the future, we will add paging support for retrieving more than 10 entries.
